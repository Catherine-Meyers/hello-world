# hello-world
My first repository as I learn about GitHub

I am new to the world of web design and am eager to learn. I find it fascinating and fun.
I took a course this past semester in college and created a website for the final project. At the moment I am working on a website for my family, along with taking a video "course" on YouTube to start a porfolio for myself and stumbled upon GitHub in the process.
